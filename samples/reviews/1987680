{"title": "Kevin Hart Reprises His Get Hard Character Without Permission", "user": "ur53337696", "date": "29 January 2019", "content": "Welcome to the latest American sullying of a beloved foreign film. The 2011 blockbuster French The Intouchables currently stands as #40 on IMDb's Top Rated Movies, and is the original film that inspired this Americanized knock-off. Truth be told, the casting of Kevin Hart very nearly works, however, either Neil Burger's lack of a backbone or taste allows Hart to ad lib his brand of squeaky hyperbolic comedy to invade otherwise convincing dramatic performance. After Hart's fourth mispronounced word (because his character's lack of education is apparently a punch-line), my patience officially evaporated.Hart plays an ex-con (this is merely a guess for the film doesn't care to provide his background) on probation named Dell. He has to complete employment papers that send him all over NYC to various employers who he only views as signatures and not viable restarts. This job scavenger hunt leads him to billionaire Phillip Lacasse (Bryan Cranston) who is shopping for a new \"life auxiliary\". After waiting a reasonable amount of time in Phillip's penthouse foyer, Dell bursts in on an interview ahead of his, and insists on grabbing the boss man's signature and getting out of this place he certainly doesn't belong in. Phillip, however, has other ideas.A quadriplegic bound to a motorized chair, Phillip is wealthy enough to buy the Mets, but appears completely empty inside. When Dell barges in, Phillip sees a shinning opportunity. He is dead set on finding an care-giver that doesn't adore him out of fear that his \"do not resuscitate\" wishes will be unmet. As Dell will say later, \"I will DNR your ass right now,\" making him the ideal and wholly unqualified candidate. After a verbal tussle, Phillip plants the idea of Dell working for him much to the chagrin of his personal assistant Yvonne, played curiously by Nicole Kidman. This casting choice elevates the film while simultaneously detracting from it. Kidman, an Australian actress, fluctuates from different accents, which is shocking considering her brilliant history of nailing American intonation, which would've suited this role arguably better.The cultural exchange between the two men is the epicenter of the feel-goodness that the film's marketing has rode into the ground. Hart's only slightly believable criminal character uses rudeness and insensitivity to sell his background which only leads to an intolerable caricature lacking almost all nuance. Cranston performs with only everything north of his neck, and proves to convey a delightful sense of adventure when faced with Hart's theatrics. Their chemistry does produce a respectable amount of chuckles and smiles, but never long enough to make you forget that Hart is desperately trying to hijack each moment.Dell brings weed to the relationship, Phillip brings opera. The symbiotic nature of their friendship highlights how ridiculous each has lived without the other. The more ambitious (if not perfectly executed) scenes has Dell selectively smashing Phillip's heirlooms upon his request after the paralyzed man's anger demands a physical, explosive catharsis. These are the moments where cracks appear in the film making but also where the story almost rises above the comedic shackles of the otherwise charming comedian turned actor.I must admit to laughing my ass off at two moments in particular, but these sequences stole the show in inappropriate manners, and left it challenging to remember the film as a whole, effectively eclipsing the larger narrative. One of the rare instances of laughs being a negative attribute, but I cannot deny the joy that comes with the frustration. An overall hollow, star-carried remake; Hollywood rapes yet another intellectual property. 1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

{"title": "MSM Can't Shake Their Bias", "user": "ur12906670", "date": "27 January 2019", "content": "Having read a few of the media's reviews, I am stunned at the mindless writings of people who are suppose to be professionals. Perhaps they're influenced by the events of Kevin Hart's statements...from a decade ago...overall..had they wanted this to be a contender for awards...they wouldn't have to try so hard to conjure up things to hate about this movie. To dispel some of the poor reviews...one mentioned why Phil (Bryan Cranston) would hire someone so unqualified. Had they been paying attention, you discover that he was hired BECAUSE he was unqualified. He put into place a decision to not resuscitate because he was miserable being a quadrapalegic. Another thing I read...how did the blind letter writer not know he was quadrapalegic? She did. She, in fact said repeatedly she searched him on Google. Unreal. Lastly, the fact that a job drops into his lap at the moment he desperately needed one and by total serendipidous mistake he shows up for the job. Nope. He mistakenly walks into a job wanting to just get a signature for his parole officer. It astonishes me critics...and I mean paid critics overlooked...the charm of the movie despite its minor logic flaws. Odd only that the same critics championed the idiotic \"Halloween\" (2018). Lost is Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart's wonderful banter. It must be nails on a chalkboard to cynica who have to have empowered angry minority women drive the story. Or some laughable Bechtdel test to satisfy the anti-male bonding flicks. This is a fine movie and one, made 10 years earlier would've had much more respect. 0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I felt pretty confident that Bryan Cranston would be the anchor for the show but was afraid Kevin Hart's style of comedy would blow it off its moorings. I worried in vain.

Well performed. Moving. Courageous. I've since found out that the premise for this movie was based on an actual relationship that was first portrayed in a much awarded French film, THE INTOUCHABLES (2011).

{"title": "A great movie and great message", "user": "ur19037357", "date": "27 January 2019", "content": "For context, my father has been paralyzed nearly my entire life (he was hit by a drunk driver when I was a baby). I hate how so many movies these days seem to give the message of \"if you're paralyzed, it's better for everyone if you just die\", but this is not one of those movies at all, and I love it.Sure, it shows the struggles and pains that come from a major disability, but it also shows the fun and joy that can still be had regardless of your level of mobility. It shows that your friends and family still love and care about you regardless. Really, it's a story of how the main character learns to find joy in his life despite his circumstances.I love this message so much because you know what? I will *always* choose to have a paralyzed dad than no dad at all. I'm in my thirties now and my dad has been there for nearly every major event of my life. And yes, he even \"danced\" with me at my wedding. We made it work.Paralysis does not mean life must end. And the best part of this movie? It's based on a true story, which makes it even better.

{"title": "The Upside - Cinema with CJ Review", "user": "ur95878573", "date": "26 January 2019", "content": "The Upside is a remake of a French film I've been meaning to see, that's also based on a true story. It's also known for a bit of casting controversy, having able-bodied Bryan Cranston play a quadriplegic billionaire, but without broaching that discussion handled much better than people more informed than I, I'll continue to just look at the face value of this movie.Which, overall, is pretty average and fine. The Upside never reaches the bounds of greatness or attaining any sense of importance or resonance, but it sure tries and thinks it has.Director Neil Burger has a great name and a string of average films, and this is no different. Funnily enough, those films are also memorable in concept but not context, where The Upside is more of the same.It's to no fault of the performances. Kevin Hart certainly tries to go beyond his comedy, but it's the stuff he's good at that's his strength here. His story is very by the numbers how you would expect it to be.Cranston continues to show that he has a brilliant range, wonderfully being comedic and dramatic when he has to.The issue with The Upside though is that...it's not anything remarkable. Some ideas feel hollow or on the nose. I wouldn't hand-wave it all as just cliche, but it does feel too familiar and as expected when you consider the situation we're given.It's strongest with its leads. Cranston and Hart have some fantastic chemistry, which seems to be a testament to Hart. He may not have the best filmography, but his chemistry with his leads usually turns out to be the closest thing to a saving grace each and every time.All the moments of real gravitas feel like flat attempts at creating so. For every by the book moment between ex-con Hart and his family, or Cranston trying to date, or Hart discovering opera, there's nothing powerful or worthwhile.Its key scenes are the light hearted ones, even if they too are predictable. There's a scene where Hart needs to replace Cranston's catheter, and if you try to picture how you think that scene plays out, it's exactly that way, even down to Hart's expressions and mannerisms.The Upside just feels like it has a solid idea and mission as a movie, but just feels phoned in and underdeveloped. The screenplay is full of smart hooks, but it's flanked by indistinguishable time skips and character moments that come out of nowhere or aren't developed enough. We have Nicole Kidman, for example, and she's never quite fully explained, yet by the end of it all she's promoted to sudden love interest status.The film just feels like a half-baked draft. We have the perfect duo for the film for better or worse, but the rest of the film feels like a placeholder for a much better film. It's charming and funny, but it never moves beyond the average. Even the cinematography and the editing feels a little unrefined. Starting in media res, The Upside (and it's trailers) certainly spoil the journey and the arc of our characters before you even get stuck into the story. It would be more ideal if you haven't seen any marketing, but that seems like an impossible task.The downside to this experience, other than the obvious issues with casting, is that while the acting is on point and it's good to see Hart try to diversify his roles a teeeeeny tiny bit, two good performances does not a good film make. It needs more.The Upside is that...at least it's not offensive and it's not entirely tone deaf...even if we're talking rich white people who need help and poor black ex-cons trying to turn over a new leaf and make things better for their family...Oh, wait, I see it now.CJ 0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I've gone with the eight to help balance out to a more realistic rating. It's not a rip off as some have ranted. It's a remake (one of several from various countries around the world based on the original French 'based on true story' movie - 'the intouchables' ) it states it's origins quite openly so therefore not a rip off. The story revolves around the hiring of a somewhat questionable man by a very wealthy quadriplegic to look after him and the situations that that brings between two very different personalities and people of different social backgrounds. Here a very good job is done by both Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart in bringing this story successfully to another audience that may otherwise not get the chance to see it. Watch it - you might like it. As rated by 'icecreammonster' 1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink", "id": "rw4602699", "rating": "8"}

{"title": "Better than critics say but not by much!", "user": "ur66040206", "date": "22 January 2019", "content": "The true story is undeniable a beautiful one, The Upside certainly aims to recreate that, but suffocates itself under poorly timed comedy and a miscast lead.As full of warmth as this movie is, any successful convey of emotions repetitively become undermined by comedic moments that feel unnecessary and out of place. Even though many laughs are worthy, tragically misplaced gags and at times close to offensive gags do not sit well with the tone of the film.Of the two leads, Cranston continuously outshines, steals scenes and leaves his co-star behind. That co-star is of course, Kevin Hart, at times he felt well suited to the role, especially in the first scenes, but as the movie proceeds the feeling he was miscast continuously creeps up and imposes on the film greatly.No chemistry between the leads was established and was abundantly clear Hart and Cranston were staring in two different movies. All supporting roles are well executed with Kidman leaving the lasting impression and outstars the entire cast.The story was however, well paced but structural wise felt out of order. The first 10 minutes were abundantly out of place and ruined any impact of future scenes which contradicts what happened in the opening (this ruined severity of many scenes which defied it). 0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film is based on a true story and a remake of the 2011 film The Untouchables which was a French film starring Omar Sy.

The chemistry between Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart was great,the story isn't all original but i'm glad to have seen it today as its impossible to find this at my local cinema.6/10C+ 0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I am english speaking and even then preferred the french movie. Having said this, my partner bawled her eyes out and she is not a 'crier' so there must be something about the story that touched many. The movie was inspired by a true event and no matter how awesome a fictional movie can be, it will never come close to 'real life' events. Kevin Hart portrayed his character well and the chemistry he had with Bryan Crankston was magical. I especially enjoyed a particular exchange he had with Nicole Kidman..hilarious.Watch this movie as its good for the soul ) If you have watched The Intouchables, then maybe you could skip it but I am sure even you want a refresher as that was 7 years ago. 0 out of 0 found this helpful.
