{"title": "Entertaining, extravagant, glittering song and dance with a bit less emotion and drama", "user": "ur0972645", "date": "28 January 2019", "content": "Unlike Hugh Jackman's mostly live musical Oscar-nominated performance in Tom Hooper's Best Oscar Movie \"Les Miserable\" (2012), The Great Showman is recorded and lipped sync'd which gives the movie's gorgeous, powerful songs, unfortunately, a sort of artificial quality reminiscent of the older, traditional grand musicals of the sixties My Fair Lady (1964), Mary Poppins (1964), and The Sound of Music (1965). There are even elements of a few scenes that have more in common with a lavish version of episodes from the television musical series Glee (2009-2015) and echoes of musical MTV videos. Nevertheless, The Greatest Showman is entertaining, extravagant with extended bursts of energetic, glittering explosive song and dance routines such as the Oscar-nominated song \"This is Me.\" The themes of love, greed, betrayal, discrimination are both timely and well presented, though not quite as emotively and dramatically riveting as Les Miserable, Moulin Rouge (2001), or another Best Picture Oscar winner Chicago (2003). 0 out of 0 found this helpful.

{"title": "Critics got it wrong...", "user": "ur40351768", "date": "26 January 2019", "content": "First off, this is obviously a fictional movie. Yes, P.T. Barnum was a real person, but this is about as loosely based on his life as a movie can get, and the movie makes no attempt to convince us otherwise. It's Hollywood, and Hollywood's job, first and foremost, is to entertain. THAT'S what this movie is about. Anyone going into it looking for a history lesson will be sorely dissappointed.Now to the movie....not since Moulin Rouge has a movie so wonderfully executed the period piece musical. The music is absolutely fantastic...hats off to Benj Pasek and Justin Paul....and, like any great musical, is an integral part of the story telling. Is the story perfect? No, but it does a wonderful job of getting the point across without being too preachy. The main takeaway is a lesson of acceptance and love, and it's a lesson that we could all use a little reminder of from time to time. If you choose to see it, do so with the goal of being entertained, and you will not be dissappointed. 0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

However, all of that changed for the better when I did and found out a few songs were mesmerizing and enchanting enough to hear. Hugh Jackman really kicked it up with another impressive musical performance following from 2012's Les Miserables now as ringmaster P.T. Barnum.In the mid-to-late nineteenth century, Phineas Taylor Barnum grew up with barely anything as a young boy, but when he found love in a young girl from a rich family who openly despised him over his impoverish background and then proposes to her as they got older, he decides to show the world what more he can do by finding unique people and performers to put on a show for all to enjoy.The amazing cast that also included Zac Efron, Zendaya, and Michelle Williams were also a plus for this movie (glad to see and hear Efron return to his singing roots since his High School Musical days). And the plot? Explaining how the duo Barnum & Bailey came to be as circus founders in musical form was something I didn't expect. I think the true breakout in the cast is Keala Settle as the Bearded Lady with her song \"This Is Me.\" True, there were some historical inaccuracies, name changes, and not meant to be entirely on point with the circus' true humble beginnings, but I'll bet this was the film crew's way of keeping the story moving with its moments of romance, drama, conflict, and deception. Despite Barnum facing so much criticism from the brutality of locals who were either discriminatory toward his circus troupe or resentful of who he is in general, he went and proved them wrong that he had a knack for making his hard work a reality, no matter who he and his troupe were.Newcomer director Michael Gracey did an exceptional job and a remarkable soundtrack (namely \"Rewrite the Stars\" performed by Zac Efron and Zendaya is also a catchy tune). Some songs still play inside my head whenever I think of this movie. I have no regrets. I enjoyed plenty. 0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

{"title": "The Greatest Showman has Rewritten the Stars", "user": "ur97902166", "date": "17 January 2019", "content": "The Greatest Showman is a cinematic wonder! Between the costumes and makeup, stunts and music, this movie truly is amazing. Michael Gracey, director from Australia, came up with a piece that only the right cast could pull off, and with talent like that of Zendaya, Hugh Jackman, and Zac Efron you can't go wrong. This movie revolves around a circus act, made up of people who are different and stand out in a crowd in ways that may make them seem to be outcasts. Hugh Jackman takes the lead role in playing a version of circus ringmaster, P.T. Barnum. Written by Bill Condon and Jenny Bicks (one of the producers of Sex and the City, as well as a well known TV director) Barnum is presented as a hero. A miracle worker to those who stand out, those who are different in the way they look, the way they act, and even the talents they possess. A large woman with a beard, would be least expected to have a voice as outstanding as Keala Settle's character does. The acrobatics performed by Zendaya and her casted brother hold unbelievable talent and ability. Jackman teaches them all to love themselves for who and what they are. The characters learn to find a sense of self worth and purpose within the work they receive from Barnum.In this particular movie, the musical numbers are staged in such a bizarre and flamboyant manner that whilst watching this movie, you might forget to pay attention to whether the actual singing and dancing are actually any good. (They are extremely expressive and well done) Arranged by Justin Paul and Benj Pasek (also composers and writers of the songs in La La Land) these numbers have that showy overbearing quality that you hear in almost every Broadway show or musical, but they're harmless and the kind of catchy that gets stuck in your head. If you choose to opt out of watching the debut of Michael Gracey's directing career, The Greatest Showman, it means you'll miss performances like Zendaya, a wonder woman with almost cotton candy like hair who spins and twirls with careful yet frivolous precision with a hanging rope; Anne Wheeler, who creates an amazing performance as a trapeze artist. She becomes somewhat of a main character, her swift and natural beauty luring in Efron's character Philip. One of the most iconic musical numbers from this film, Rewrite the Stars, Anne expresses her love for Philip as well as her desire for him to accept and stand up for what he believes in. To stand up and defend her, no matter her race or social class. Efron's character however, spends more time in sheer awe of her beauty and simplicity rather than acting on any emotion. He's completely stunned by her.As all things eventually do, the circus crashed after a massive fire was started, mid street brawl. Barnum's fraudulent and borrowed successes, their pride, their pedestal, it all went up in flames. Gracey (director) made clear efforts to show the effect that this crash had on not only the circus, but the town. A grey filter overtook the happiness in the scene, the mood changed to a more somber tone. They became the laughing stock of the town, people began to ridicule them. Barnum had lost his business, the support of the people, and after recent events at an show across the globe, his wife had temporarily left to clear her mind. All of the 'misfits' follow closely behind Barnum as he sulks his way to the town saloon to drink away his losses, and as they realize they all still have each other, we hear a song with true meaning. Starting out with a solo part by Hugh Jackman, \"From Now On\" a song, slow and melancholy, again with that very gray and depressing color overtaking the scene, is at first an indirect apology to his wife and all of the circus for letting them down. It slowly picks up, and the scene starts to have color and life again. He slowly starts to talk about his successes and how *those were someone else's dreams* while realizing that everything he had gone through had given his life a purpose and made him happy. *a man learns who is there for him when the glitter fades and the walls won't hold* This song turns into a drinking song, the energy in the bar becomes uncontainable and they start to sing and dance with Barnum on his way out the door, as he continues singing lead while running down the sidewalk. Slowly we start to see the sunset's golden glow from behind the clouds, the life is returning to the town as people begin to walk out of their stores and homes and onto the streets. Gracey uses color to help show the mood in this film, as commonly done in many different movies, and it helps you relate emotionally to what's going on during the film. His appropriate use of color in this particular film allow the audience to experience the happiness and excitement during the shows P.T. Barnum puts on, as well as the sadness and strength of the 'misfits' when they walk through the crowds of angry, disapproving people who want peace, quiet and normalcy in their town. Scenes with bright color are typically the scenes with high energy and they're the highlights of the film, in this case, the shows and dances that kids try to copy at home and the songs they go home singing. The scenes with a seemingly drained lighting are those like the circus after the fire had destroyed its walls and spirit inside them. Like Barnum and his fellow employees in the beginning, when everyone was laid off, before Barnum started fraudulently climbing his way to the top of success; both scenes with a very somber mood.Ultimately, the immense and utter cinematic skill used to put together the amazing, The Greatest Showman is remarkable. This puts previous attempts like the 1934, The Mighty Barnum and A Lady's Morals of 1930 almost to shame. And while the ideas and creativity are similar to that of The Great and Powerful Oz, this film has something that Oz does not, and that is the ability to feel as if you are inside the movie itself. The Greatest Showman captures its audience and takes them on every journey along with the characters and the stories and adventures they make come to life. The best kinds of movies are able to captivate their audience a lot like Gracey's work with this film, and he did an outstanding job. 0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

Maybe it was the subject matter, no matter how you spin it it was about a showman exploiting people to make money. He lied, stole and cheated; not a particularly nice character. There was some change of heart at the end in this film version of Barnum's life, but apparently not in reality. Hugh Jackman was wonderful as were most of the cast and I wish they had been given a better story to tell. Was it made because it epitomises the \"American dream\", poor boy makes good and becomes famous and wealthy - at any cost - then finds his heart again? Because Hugh Jackman was in it I couldn't help but compare this to the brilliance of the story of Les Miserables, which is about things that matter, redemption, goodness etc As against this shallow, grasping man's life story. 0 out of 0 found this helpful.

{"title": "Great music, but not much else", "user": "ur23695069", "date": "15 January 2019", "content": "This movie is essentially just a series of lavishly produced and heavily stylized musical numbers held together by a flimsy and perfunctory plot. Anyone looking for any insight into the life of PT Barnum (albeit with music) or, surprisingly, some emotional depth should look elsewhere.This movie is simply an assault on your senses, and I don't mean that in a bad way. Visually and aurally it is fantastic. I found it completely lacking in emotional impact however, even though some of the songs are definitely meant to evoke emotion. This is possibly because the movie never slows down or quietens down enough to allow emotion to build. I did not dislike this at all. At the end of it all though, I felt curiously unmoved.I did enjoy the original soundtrack for the most part and kudos goes to the composers. It will be interesting to see if these songs have a life beyond the run of the movie as many songs from other musicals have.On a technical level, the production was excellent although some of the CGI animals were obviously CGI. A good number of the actors were quite obviously miming their songs to some one else's voice. Make up was top notch and acting was great too.Go and see this movie and enjoy it as a great concert, just don't go expecting a great movie. 0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

Hugh Jackman is down right one of my favourite actors, as he always fits perfectly into any role that you start to believe no one else would be more perfect for the role, but him. i have to be honest, i didn't think Zac Efron alongside Zendaya would work so well, but their chemistry on screen was great, because it reflected the love and care they have for each other off screen. oh and the soundtrack, well that was just absolutely amazing. each song was better than the last, and all the choreography for all the dances were astonishing. each song and dance spoke to everyone, and even brought a tear to my eye. this fantastically written musical brings together everyone that has something that makes them unique, and is proud to do so. i highly recommend this film to absolutely anyone, you don't need to be a fan of musicals, romance or comedy, just to be a fan of what makes a family and the magic life has to offer. 0 out of 0 found this helpful.

{"title": "It had promise...", "user": "ur1291905", "date": "12 January 2019", "content": "The Greatest Showman had promise - it failed with the Broadway musical approach.Sets were constructed as if for a broadway stage (low budget and poorly executed by movie theater standards). Musical numbers were catchy and relatively good, but did not fit the movie or the venue.The bottom line is this - if I want to see a Broadway play, I will go to New York City and see a broadway play. I do not want to see a Broadway play on my local movie theater screen.

{"title": "All flash, no filling", "user": "ur3585965", "date": "12 January 2019", "content": "Great music! Cool musical moments. But I really wish this movie wasn't based on a real person. If it were a pure fantasy, I could have gotten into this more. But knowing PT Barnum is who he is, I constantly wondered 'how did this event really happen.' Because the movie churns through scenes without developing characters or really showing you how Barnum got his ideas/became famous and instead flips the events into moments of fantasy. And that is the main problem - we don't get to know any of the characters particularly well (even Barnum). The script glosses over everything with pizzazz and spectacle but never lets the audience feel, understand or know why characters acted the way they did. Instead, it is a paint-by-numbers formula of every other musical you've ever seen, bringing nothing new to the mix (just a mishmash of cliches). I want to feel sad when the character loses something because I was along with the journey with them and understand their loss, or come to the conclusion that a character was truly motivated to be loved through the scenes and actions of the characters that I saw. Instead The Greatest Showman tells you 'this is the scene where you're supposed to cry' with its loud music and flash. So in an ironic way, this film is the perfect representation of Barnum's work/career - something of spectacle and no substance. 0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

{"title": "Look Out Cause Here Comes A Great Film!", "user": "ur95182476", "date": "10 January 2019", "content": "P.T Barnum became orphaned at a young age, left all alone in the world and poor. But that never stopped him from being creative and full of imagination, or a desire to become something memorable in the world.After marrying his childhood sweetheart and being a proud father of two daughters, Barnum (Hugh Jackson) loses his job and struggles once again to make ends meet. Barnum soon gets a creative spark and risks it all with the dream of becoming a Great Showman who presents the odd, the strange and the unique to the world.In case you're not aware, this film is a musical. Being a musical, this will normally scare away many movie goers as the film promises some singing and dancing. But, I'm happy to admit that The Greatest Showman is far more than just another musical film. This film had a great story and fantastic acting.Hugh Jackman (no surprise) is solid as the leading character, once again giving audience members chills and watery eyes from his performance alone. From the opening act it didn't take long for his character to become someone rather fun and likeable. Other acting performances from both Michelle Williams and Zac Efron were also well cast and provided outstanding supportive roles. Going into this movie, I never thought I would come out saying that one of my favorite musical numbers would be a number between Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron.Another point of praise is the film's pacing. Let it be known on social media that I am not a major fan of musical films (more so when they are very sad musicals ...), but this is a musical film that is fast pace and well timed. Even during the Musical numbers, I never felt bored with the musical scene, nor did I ever roll my eyes and think 'oh man not another damn song'. Each song tells a story and that story moves quickly, full of excitement and without feeling dull or uninteresting. All the musical tracks of this movie are new and have many creative elements to them. Combining this with the film's great story, you have film that can be enjoyed by all ages. I enjoyed the film's positive message and I would easily recommend this film be viewed by many.It should have came as no surprise that this film's success has come heavily from another outstanding performance from Hugh Jackman. There is so much praise to be given to the many other cast members such as actress Michelle Williams. I also feel this was an excellent choice for the actor Zac Efron as he took a break from doing crude comedy films. Even if you're not a fan of musical films (like me), this is film that really shouldn't be missed. There is more to enjoy than just musical numbers here- this is film that carries amazing cinema elements and will leave you joyful.8.8/10 Finesse Movie Reviews 1 out of 1 found this helpful.

{"title": "A wonderful film", "user": "ur24070014", "date": "3 January 2019", "content": "First I want to compare the reviews to Lala Land which was praised by critics but condemned by the audience. It seems like this film is going through the opposite critics hate it, audiences love it. And I can only chant along with the praising, just saw it for the second time and yet another time I'm astonished from this completely wonderful film! First of all it is very nice shot with beautiful scenes, lightning and camera-work. The singing and dancing is so inspired (again compare to lalaland where they dance like sticks and sing without inspiration) and you can tell the cast had fun doing this (TIP watch rehearsals, so lovely). Over all everything is excellently delivered and the story is so beautiful with many layers that all take their place without being skipped or taking to much screentime. WATCH THIS FILM. The soundtrack is gospel-inspired with a touch of modern pop so don't expect classic musical-feels to it. Expect more. Cause this film is more and it soars over what critics seem to comprehend.
